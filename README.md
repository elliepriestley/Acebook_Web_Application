# Acebook - Team Water üåä

In this project, we were tasked with working on an existing 'bare bones' social media application, to improve its functionality and add features over a two week period. A significant part of the challenge was familiarising ourselves with the inherited codebase, as we worked to **improve and extend** it.

We also used Cloudinary to host images from user posts

## Additional Resources

We used Trello as a project managament tool during this project. You can find a link to the board here: https://trello.com/b/ZU22GcBv/team-water-acebook

## Quickstart

### Install Node.js

1. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)
   ```
   brew install nvm
   ```
   Then follow the instructions to update your `~/.bash_profile`.
2. Open a new terminal
3. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), currently `18.1.0`.
   ```
   nvm install 18
   ```


### Set up your project

1. Fork this repository
2. Rename your fork to `acebook-<team name>`
3. Clone your fork to your local machine
4. Install Node.js dependencies for both the `frontend` and `api` directories.
   ```
   ; cd api
   ; npm install
   ; cd ../frontend
   ; npm install
   ```
5. Install cloudinary, axios, and dotenv dependencies separately in the root directory
   ```
   ; cd ..
   ; npm install cloudinary axios dotenv
   ```

> You might get warning messages about the installed dependencies at this point. You can ignore them, as long as the installation process doesn't fail.

6. Install an ESLint plugin for your editor. For example: [`linter-eslint`](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint) for Atom.
6. Install MongoDB
   ```
   brew tap mongodb/brew
   brew install mongodb-community@5.0
   ```
   *Note:* If you see a message that says `If you need to have mongodb-community@5.0 first in your PATH, run:`, follow the instruction. Restart your terminal after this.
7. Start MongoDB
   ```
   brew services start mongodb-community@5.0
   ```
8. Update lines 13-15 within the www file in api/bin with your cloudinary API details.

### How to run the server and use the app (as a human)

1. Start the server application (in the `api` directory)

  **Note the use of an environment variable for the JWT secret**

   ```
   ; cd api
   ; JWT_SECRET=f6d278bb34e1d0e146a80b16ec254c05 npm start
   ```
2. Start the front end application (in the `frontend` directory)

  In a new terminal session...

  ```
  ; cd frontend
  ; npm start
  ```

You should now be able to open your browser and will be directed automatically to the signup page. Enjoy!


### üß™ Running the tests

The automated tests run by sending actual HTTP requests to the API. Therefore, before anything, you'll need to start the backend server in test mode (so that it connects to the test DB).

**Note the use of an environment variable for the JWT secret**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the api directory
; cd api

; JWT_SECRET=f6d278bb34e1d0e146a80b16ec254c05 npm run start:test
```

You should leave this running in a terminal.

Then, you can either run tests for the backend or the frontend following the steps below. 

#### Running tests for the backend

Run the tests in a new terminal session:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the api directory
; cd api

; JWT_SECRET=f6d278bb34e1d0e146a80b16ec254c05 npm run test
```

####  Running tests for the frontend

Start the front end in a new terminal session

```bash
# Make sure you're in the frontend directory
; cd frontend

; JWT_SECRET=f6d278bb34e1d0e146a80b16ec254c05 npm start
```

Then run the tests in a new terminal session

```bash
# Make sure you're in the frontend directory
; cd frontend

; JWT_SECRET=f6d278bb34e1d0e146a80b16ec254c05 npm run test
```

## MongoDB Connection Errors?

Some people occasionally experience MongoDB connection errors when running the tests or trying to use the application. Here are some tips which might help resolve such issues.

- Check that MongoDB is installed using `mongo --version`
- Check that it's running using `brew services list`
